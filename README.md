# Weather App

This is my first project using react. You can type in a location (district, city, country, continent) and it will give you today's weather and the weather for the next 5 days. In addition it will show you a picture of the location as a background.

# Installing

After you download this project you have to install the dependencies with:

`npm install`

To start the project:

`npm start`


# Description

You have to put in the location in **english** and **click** the search button instead of pressing enter.

The App still has many buggs that's not fixed yet.
The following still needs to be fixed:

1. If you type in a term in which there is no picture in the database the following will appear:
![alt text](https://raw.github.com/LuqmanSatrio/WetterApp-React-/master/Buggs-Screenshot/unhandledPictureError.png)

2. If you type in a location where there is no weather data the data might not be updated although the picture might.
